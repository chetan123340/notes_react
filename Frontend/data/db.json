      "content": "Today's focus is on upper body strength training. Start with a warm-up of light cardio and dynamic stretches. The main workout will consist of three sets of 10-12 repetitions for each exercise, targeting chest, back, shoulders, and arms. Exercises could include push-ups, rows (dumbbell or bodyweight), overhead press, bicep curls, and tricep extensions. Don't forget to cool down with static stretches to prevent muscle soreness."
