## Project Name: React Blog App


**Description**

This is a full-featured blog application built using React, Bootstrap, and JSON Server. It allows users to create, read, update, and delete blog posts (CRUD operations). The JSON Server simulates a backend API, providing a convenient way to store and manage blog data locally.

**Features**

- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) Operations: Manage blog posts efficiently.
- React: Leverage the power of React for a dynamic and user-friendly experience.
- Bootstrap: Utilize Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing design.
- JSON Server: Simulate a backend API for data persistence.
- Modern Development Environment: Enjoy a streamlined development experience with npm scripts.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can verify this by running `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) in your terminal.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Use Git to clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-blog-app.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.
3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required dependencies by running:
   ```bash
   cd react-blog-app
   npm install
   ```

**Running the Application**

1. **Start JSON Server:** In a separate terminal window, initiate the JSON Server to serve the mock data:
   ```bash
   npm json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000
   ```
   This command starts the JSON Server, watching for changes in your `data/db.json` file and serving data on port 8000 by default.
2. **Run React Development Server:** In the main project directory, start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This opens your blog app in the browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000/`.
